   abstract = {General relativity predicts that clocks run more slowly near massive objects. The effect is small---a clock at sea level lags behind one 1000 m above sea level by only 9.4 ns/day. Here, we demonstrate that a measurement of this effect can be done by undergraduate students. Our paper describes an experiment conducted by undergraduate researchers at Colorado College and the United States Air Force Academy to measure gravitational time dilation. The measurement was done by comparing the signals generated by a GPS frequency standard (sea-level time) to a Cs-beam frequency standard at seven different altitudes above sea level. We found that our measurements are consistent with the predictions of general relativity.},

@article{Czarnecka2020,
   abstract = {We demonstrate that a de Broglie wave of a particle in a gravitational field turns towards the region of a smaller gravitational potential, causing the particle to fall. This turning is caused by clocks running slower in the smaller potential. We use the analogy of ocean waves that are slower in shallower water and turn towards beaches. This approach explains the free fall qualitatively and quantitatively without postulating motion along geodesics and with only elementary algebra.},
